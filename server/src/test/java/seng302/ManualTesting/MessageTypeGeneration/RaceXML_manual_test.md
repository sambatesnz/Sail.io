##### Sending Race Xml
As a user I want to see the correct marks set for a race


#####Context:
    See the value of compound marks in test/resources/Race.xml
    Run RaceXMLTeset.java
    Run the visualiser
    
#####Expected Results:
    The compound marks should be set to the same as the default CSSE Server race
    Can be verified by plotting coords found in race.xml on a map (if needed).
