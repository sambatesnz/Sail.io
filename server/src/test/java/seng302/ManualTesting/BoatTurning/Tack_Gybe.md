#####Context:
    To test the tack/gybe button and ensure that when pressed, the boat tacks or gybes
    in the appropriate direction, and the boat heading does not automatically jump to 
    the other heading.
    Set up a race and connect to the server. Move the boat to ensure that it is not 
    too close in angle to the wind direction. Press the tack/gybe button
    
#####Expected Results:
    The boats heading changes to the opposite side of the wind direction, in the 
    appropriate direction. The angle of the boat heading from the wind is
     the opposite of what it was previously.
