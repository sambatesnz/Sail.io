#####Context:
    Connect to a server from the visualiser. Press the Z key to center the view on on a boat. Observe the view.
    Use the scroll wheel to zoom in (scroll up), observe the view,
    Use the scroll wheel to zoom out (scroll down), observe the view.
    Control the boat to move some distance
    
    
#####Expected Results:
