Test that the zooming functionality scales all the graphics correctly and follows the boat correctly.

##### Sail Test
#####Context:
    Connect to a server from the visualiser. Press the Z key to center the view on on a boat. Observe the view.
    Use the scroll wheel to zoom in (scroll up), observe the view,
    Use the scroll wheel to zoom out (scroll down), observe the view.
    Control the boat to move some distance
    
    
#####Expected Results:
    The view is centered on the boat
    The wake, boat, sail, boat text, control circle, marks, gates and any other graphics that should zoom scale relative to the map size
