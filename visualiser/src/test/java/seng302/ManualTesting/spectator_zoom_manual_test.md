# Spectate Races 
Test whether or not client(s) can spectate a race in progress

##### Sail Test
#####Context:
    Begin a multiplayer race.
    Once the race has entered Pre-Start, boot n visualisers.
    Restart one of the racing boat visualisers (in intelliJ)
    
#####Expected Results:
    Visualisers started after the Pre-Start has begun, will not be capable of 
    controlling any boats.
    Visualisers that reconnect to a race can only spectate.
