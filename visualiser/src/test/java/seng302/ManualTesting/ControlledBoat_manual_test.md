#####Controlled Boat Test

* Date of Testing: 26/7/17

In order to test this feature, we have connected a client to the server and instantiated a race.
From here, as the boats are displayed, there will be one boat with a red circle surrounding its sprite.
When the tester presses the page up or page down buttons, the boat that is surrounded by the red circle will
respond and move according to the button presses.
