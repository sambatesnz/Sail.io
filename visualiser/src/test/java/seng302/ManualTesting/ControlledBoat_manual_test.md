##### Controlled Boat Test
#####Context:
    In order to test this feature, we have connected a client to the server and instantiated a race.
    From here, as the boats are displayed, there will be one boat with a red circle surrounding its sprite.
    
#####Expected Results:
    When the tester presses the page up or page down buttons, the boat that is surrounded by the red circle will
    respond and move according to the button presses.
