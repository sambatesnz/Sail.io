#Connecting to different game modes

#####Context:
    This test is to ensure that that the user can connect to 3 different game modes (agar, race, practice)
    
    To set up the test:
        Connect to the vm in the terminal: ssh sengstudent@csse-s302g2.canterbury.ac.nz
        The password is south502
        Nagivate to the latest version of the server jar
        Run java -jar jarname -mode=race
        Run java -jar jarname -mode=agar
        Connect visualiser to each mode
        Run java -jar jarname -mode=practice **locally**
    
#####Expected Results:
    The race should start appropriately
    If you are trying to connect to agar or practice the input field should disappear
